# 🚀 90 Days of DevOps Journey  

I’m documenting my daily progress and learnings from my **90-Day DevOps Learning Path**.  

---

## 📅 Day 2 – Operating Systems & Linux  

### ✅ What I Learned  
- **Operating System (OS)** – Software that connects users, applications, and hardware.  
- **Linux** – Open-source, secure, and widely used in servers & DevOps.  
- **Linux Architecture** –  
  - **Kernel** → Core of the OS (manages resources).  
  - **Shell** → Interface to run commands.  
  - **File System** → Organizes data.  
  - **Applications** → User programs.  
- **Linux File System** – Everything is treated as a file, organized under `/` (root).  
- **Basic Commands** – `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`.  

✨ **Key Lesson**: Linux is the backbone of DevOps — learning it is like learning the **language of servers**!
