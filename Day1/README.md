## 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to DevOps  

### ✅ What I Learned  
- **DevOps** – Brings Developers & Operations together to build and deliver software faster.  
- **DevOps Lifecycle** – Steps: *Plan → Code → Test → Release → Run → Monitor → Improve*.  
- **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** – Process: *Plan → Design → Build → Test → Deploy → Maintain*.
