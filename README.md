# 🚀 90 Days of DevOps Journey  

I’m documenting my daily progress and learnings from my **90-Day DevOps Learning Path**.

## 📅 Day 3 – Linux Users, Permissions, Processes & More  

### ✅ What I Learned  
- **Users & Groups** – Manage access and permissions.  
- **File Permissions** – `Read (r)`, `Write (w)`, `Execute (x)`.  
- **Processes & Jobs** – View and control running tasks (`ps`, `top`, `kill`, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`).  
- **Networking & Package Management** – Tools like `ping`, `apt`, `yum`.  
- **Logs & Monitoring** – Use `/var/log` for troubleshooting and system health.  

✨ **Key Lesson**: Mastering these Linux basics is **essential for every DevOps engineer**!
